        This website hosts a variety of simple games meant to study
        human-computer interaction. One phenomenon we study to better understand
        this interaction is sensorimotor synchronization (SMS). Humans
        synchronize with each other all the time - a round of applause, musical
        performances, sports games, etc. The act of synchronization can yield a
        wealth of information on how human's interact with outside stimuli and
        the strategies we employ to adapt to our environments.

        The process of synchronizing with an auditory or visual cue is well-
        documented. However, this interaction, "accounts for only a small
        proportion of all SMS activities in daily life," but research on SMS has
        focused, "almost exclusively" on these instancesÂ [1]. Our research aims
        to study peer-to-peer instances of SMS, and use this phenomenon as a
        launchpad to improve our understanding of human-machine interaction. One
        way this interaction can be studied in a research environment is by
        setting up a machine to act as a second human by changing its behavior
        in response to human action.

        The bouncing ball game is a simple example of this. When the player taps
        the ball, an ITI (Inter-Tap interval) is recorded. Based on this
        interval and how far off the player was from syncing with the machine,
        the game state can progress in different ways - the ball's bouncing
        period can increase or decrease based on how the machine reacts to the
        player.
